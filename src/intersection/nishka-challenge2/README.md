# Intersection: use built-in array methods

Write a function that finds all the values shared between two arrays.

---

## Strategy

I chose to used built-in array methods to solve this challenge because I find them fun and easy to use. Makes my code easier to read.

## Implementation

-first I used the .filter() method to make sure there are no duplicates returned in my answer.

-I then used the filter method along with .includes() to check what numbers are the same in both arrays and then returned them.
